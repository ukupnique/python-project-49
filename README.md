# <strong>Brain Games</strong>

This repository was created as part of a Hexlet study project. "Brain Games" is a collection of five console games. In each game, players are presented with questions that must be answered correctly. Upon providing three correct answers, the game is considered complete. An incorrect answer ends the game and prompts the player to try again.
